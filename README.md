# Open Targets Post-Pipeline ETL process

OpenTargets ETL pipeline to process Pipeline output in order to obtain a new API shaped entities. For the file 
`platformDataBackend.sc`

## platformDataBackend.sc

### Requirements

1. OpenJDK 1.8
2. scala 2.12.x (through SDKMAN is simple)
3. ammonite REPL
4. Drug index dump from OpenTargets ES
5. Target index dump from OpenTargets ES
5. Disease index dump from OpenTargets ES
5. Evidence index dump from OpenTargets ES
5. Expression index dump from OpenTargets ES

### Run the scala script

```sh
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx<mostofthememingigslike100G>"
# to compute the dataset
time amm platformDataBackend.sc \
    --drugFilename 19.06_drug-data.json \
    --targetFilename 19.06_gene-data.json \
    --diseaseFilename 19.06_efo-data.json \
    --evidenceFilename 19.06_evidence-data.json \
    --outputPathPrefix out/
```

### Generate the indices dump from ES7

You will need to either connect to a machine containing the ES or forward the ssh port from it
```sh
elasticdump --input=http://localhost:9200/<indexyouneed> \
    --output=<indexyouneed>.json \
    --type=data  \
    --limit 10000 \
    --sourceOnly
```

## platformEvidenceDrugAggregation.sc

This script generates the Disease-drug-phase-status-target... aggregation is order to obtain a ready 
to aggregate table for drugs and clinical trials. To run it just use `--help` to get the list of 
command line parameters.
